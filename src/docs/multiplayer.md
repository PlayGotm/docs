# Multiplayer

On Gotm your players can connect to each other using [NetworkedMultiplayerENet](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_networkedmultiplayerenet.html) or [PacketPeerUDP](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_packetpeerudp.html) without plugins or port-forwarding.
Players connect through a unique invitation link that is generated when a player hosts a game.

Try it out!

<game>[](/gdgotm-examples/networkedmultiplayerenet)</game>

_Press "Host" to generate an invitation link. Join the game by entering the link in a new browser window and pressing "Join"._

The above game example uses [NetworkedMultiplayerENet](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_networkedmultiplayerenet.html) to connect players in a shared drawing session.

# Get started

You can quickly get started by downloading the [example project](https://github.com/PlayGotm/gdgotm-examples/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
The [web player](/web-player) is recommended for testing your game on Gotm without having to sign in.

# Generate invitation link

When you call [NetworkedMultiplayerENet.create_server](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_networkedmultiplayerenet.html#class-networkedmultiplayerenet-method-create-server) or [PacketPeerUDP.listen](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_packetpeerudp.html#class-packetpeerudp-method-listen) Gotm automatically generates an invitation link.
The link is shown in a popup, so it can easily be copied and shared with other players.

###### Create server

```gdscript
var peer = NetworkedMultiplayerENet.new()
peer.create_server(8070)
get_tree().set_network_peer(peer)
```

# Accept invitation

Accept the invitation by entering the link in another browser window.
You can now connect to the host using [NetworkedMultiplayerENet.create_client](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_networkedmultiplayerenet.html#class-networkedmultiplayerenet-method-create-server) or with your custom PacketPeerUDP code.

###### Create client

```gdscript
var peer = NetworkedMultiplayerENet.new()
peer.create_client("127.0.0.1", 8070)
get_tree().set_network_peer(peer)
```

# (Optional) Find the host

All players that have accepted the invitation have joined a shared virtual local network.
This allows your game to send and receive RPC commands and packets to these players using methods like [Node.rpc](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_node.html?#class-node-method-rpc) or [PacketPeerUDP.put_packet](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_packetpeer.html#class-packetpeer-method-put-packet). You can read more about Godot's networking and RPC commands [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html).

The easiest way to connect to the host is by using the special `127.0.0.1` address:

###### Connect to host

```gdscript
var peer = NetworkedMultiplayerENet.new()
peer.create_client("127.0.0.1", 8070)
```

This address always points to the player that created the invitation link. If you want to manually discover hosts with custom PacketPeerUDP broadcasting, that works too:

###### Broadcast message to all player

```gdscript
var peer = PacketPeerUDP.new()
peer.set_broadcast_enabled(true) ### Only needed for 3.2 or later.
peer.set_dest_address("255.255.255.255", 8070)
peer.put_var("Sent to all players in network.")
```

_Note: To send a packet to yourself with PacketPeerUDP you can use `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1`._
