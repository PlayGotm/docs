# Create scores

When creating scores, you need to provide two things:

1. A score `name` which describes what the score represents, for example "bananas_collected" or "time_elapsed".
1. A score `value` which describes how much the score is worth compared to other scores with the same name.

Create scores with [GotmScore](https://github.com/PlayGotm/GDGotm/blob/master/gotm/GotmScore.gd)`.create`. In the example below we create three scores with the name "bananas_collected", and their values are 1, 2 and 3.

###### Create GotmScores

```gdscript
var score_name = "bananas_collected"
var score1: GotmScore = yield(GotmScore.create(score_name, 1), "completed")
var score2: GotmScore = yield(GotmScore.create(score_name, 2), "completed")
var score3: GotmScore = yield(GotmScore.create(score_name, 3), "completed")
```

BETA NOTICE: Scores and leaderboards are currently beta features. See the beta notice at the top of this page for more information.

## User data

When you create a score, the current user's id is automatically assigned to the score's `user_id` field. If you create a score while the current user is signed into Gotm, the user id of that score will point to a registered user which you can fetch with [GotmUser](https://github.com/PlayGotm/GDGotm/blob/master/gotm/GotmUser.gd)`.fetch`.

###### Fetch user of a score

```gdscript
# Fetch the Gotm-registered user that created score1.
var user: GotmUser = yield(GotmUser.fetch(score1.user_id), "completed")
if user:
    # User is a registered Gotm user and has a display name.
    # Access it with the user.display_name field.
    pass
else:
    # User is not registered and has no display name.
    pass
```

# Fetch scores

Scores are fetched with a [GotmLeaderboard](https://github.com/PlayGotm/GDGotm/blob/master/gotm/GotmLeaderboard.gd) instance, which acts as a filter when fetching scores. You do not need to create a leaderboard before creating scores.

###### Create a leaderboard

```gdscript
var top_leaderboard = GotmLeaderboard.new()
top_leaderboard.name = score_name
```

Use `get_scores` to fetch up to 20 top scores in descending order (highest value first).

###### Get scores in leaderboard

```gdscript
# Returns [score3, score2, score1]
var top_scores = yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores(), "completed")
```

## Fetch surrounding scores

Use `get_surrounding_scores` to fetch up to 20 scores above and and 20 below a certain score.

###### Get surrounding scores in leaderboard

```gdscript
# Returns {"before": [score3], "score": score2, "after": [score1]}
var surrounding_scores = yield(top_leaderboard.get_surrounding_scores(score2), "completed")
```

You can also get scores above and below a certain value...

###### Get surrounding scores in leaderboard by value

```gdscript
# Returns {"before": [score3], "score": score2, "after": [score1]}
var surrounding_scores_by_value = yield(top_leaderboard.get_surrounding_scores(2.5), "completed")
```

... or above and below a certain rank with `get_surrounding_scores_by_rank`.

###### Get surrounding scores in leaderboard by rank

```gdscript
# Returns {"before": [score3], "score": score2, "after": [score1]}
var surrounding_scores_by_rank = yield(top_leaderboard.get_surrounding_scores_by_rank(2), "completed")
```

## Fetch scores after

Pass a score to `get_scores` to fetch up to 20 scores after that score.

###### Get scores that comes after another score

```gdscript
# Returns [score1]
var scores_after_score_id = yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores(score2), "completed")
```

You can also get scores after certain value...

###### Get scores that come after a value

```gdscript
# Returns [score1]
var scores_after_value = yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores(2), "completed")
```

... or after a certain rank with `get_scores_by_rank`.

###### Get scores that come after a rank

```gdscript
# Returns [score2, score1]
var scores_after_rank = yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores_by_rank(1), "completed")
```

## Fetch score counts

Use `get_count` to get the total number of scores that matches the leaderboard.

###### Get the number of scores in a leaderboard

```gdscript
# Returns 3
var score_count = yield(top_leaderboard.get_count(), "completed")
```

You can also use `get_counts` to get counts across a range of values, which is useful if you want to display distribution graphs.

###### Get segmented score counts in a leaderboard

```gdscript
# Fetches the number of scores between 0 and 4, in 4 ranges.
# Returns [0, 1, 1, 1], because there are 0 scores in the range [0, 1),
# 1 score in [1, 2), 1 score in [2, 3) and 1 score in [3, 4], where ")"
# is exclusive.
var score_counts = yield(top_leaderboard.get_counts(0, 4, 4), "completed")
```

## Fetch rank

Use `get_rank` to get the rank of a score. Ranks start at 1, which means that the score with the highest value in a leaderboard has rank 1.

###### Get a score's rank

```gdscript
# Returns 1
var rank_from_score_id = yield(top_leaderboard.get_rank(score3), "completed")
```

You can also pass a value to get the rank a score would have if it would have that value.

###### Get a value's rank

```gdscript
# Returns 2
var rank_from_value = yield(top_leaderboard.get_rank(2.5), "completed")
```

## Invert score order

If you want rank 1 to be the score with lowest value instead of the highest value, set the `is_inverted` field to `true` on your `GotmLeaderboard` instance.

###### Get inverted rank and scores

```gdscript
top_leaderboard.is_inverted = true
# Returns 3
var inverted_rank = yield(top_leaderboard.get_rank(score3), "completed")
# Returns [score1, score2, score3]
var inverted_scores = yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores(), "completed")
```

## Rank older scores higher

If you want older scores to rank higher than newer scores with the same value, set the `is_oldest_first` field to `true` on your `GotmLeaderboard` instance.

###### Get ranks using a "oldest wins" policy

```gdscript
# score1 was rank 3, but is now 4 because score1_copy is a newer score with the same value
# and therefore took score1's place.
var score1_copy: GotmScore = yield(GotmScore.create(score1.name, score1.value), "completed")
# Returns 3
var score1_copy_rank_with_newest_first = yield(top_leaderboard.get_rank(score1_copy), "completed")
top_leaderboard.is_oldest_first = true
# Returns 4
var score1_copy_rank_with_oldest_first = yield(top_leaderboard.get_rank(score1_copy), "completed")
```

# Modify scores

Use `update` to update a score.

###### Update a score

```gdscript
yield(score2.update(5), "completed")
# Returns [score2, score3, score1]
yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores(), "completed")
```

Use `delete` to delete a score.

###### Delete a score

```gdscript
yield(score2.delete(), "completed")
# Returns [score3, score1]
yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores(), "completed")
```

# Filter scores

Gotm provides a powerful way to filter scores in multiple ways with `GotmLeaderboard` by setting any of the `properties`, `is_unique`, `period` or `user_id` fields.

## Filter by properties

Scores have an optional `properties` field where you can store your own metadata. You can also filter scores by these properties.

###### Get scores by properties

```gdscript
# Update properties on score
yield(score1.update(null, {"difficulty": "hard", "level": 25}), "completed")
# Set properties filter on leaderboard
top_leaderboard.properties = {"difficulty": "hard"}
# Returns [score1]
yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores(), "completed")
# Returns 1
yield(top_leaderboard.get_rank(score1), "completed")
```

## Filter by unique per user

If the same user creates multiple scores they will all show up in your fetches by default. Use `is_unique` to only fetch the last created score per user.

###### Get unique scores

```gdscript
top_leaderboard.is_unique = true
# Returns [score3]
yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores(), "completed")
# Returns 1
yield(top_leaderboard.get_rank(score3), "completed")
```

## Filter by time period

Scores created at any time are included in your fetches by default. Use `period` to only fetch scores that were created within a certain time period.

###### Get scores created within a time period

```gdscript
# Only include scores created in the last 24 hours
top_leaderboard.period = GotmPeriod.sliding(GotmPeriod.TimeGranularity.DAY)

# Only include scores created today
top_leaderboard.period = GotmPeriod.offset(GotmPeriod.TimeGranularity.DAY, 0)

# Only include scores created two days ago.
top_leaderboard.period = GotmPeriod.offset(GotmPeriod.TimeGranularity.DAY, -2)

# Only include scores created in February 2019
top_leaderboard.period = GotmPeriod.at(GotmPeriod.TimeGranularity.MONTH, 2019, 2)
```

## Filter by user

Scores created from any users are included in your fetches by default. Use `user_id` to only fetch scores that were created by a particular user.

###### Specify a user's leaderboard

```gdscript
top_leaderboard.user_id = "<A_USER_ID>"
```

# Display Scores

One way to display the scores in your game is to build a string to display the list with the rank of each score, the user's name or "Guest" if the user is not registered, and the value of the score. You can then display this string inside of a label.

```gdscript
var strLeaderboard = ""

var top_scores = yield(top_leaderboard.get_scores(), "completed")
for score in top_scores:
	var rank = yield(top_leaderboard.get_rank(score), "completed")
	strLeaderboard += (str(rank) + ": ")
	var user : GotmUser = yield(GotmUser.fetch(score.user_id), "completed")
	if user:
		strLeaderboard += (user.display_name + ("    "))
	else:
		strLeaderboard += "Guest    "
	strLeaderboard += (str(score.value) + "\n")
```

# Manage scores in the dashboard

You can easily browse, delete and edit scores in the tools section of [your game's dashboard](/dashboard/_/_?p=tools&highlight=leaderboards).
